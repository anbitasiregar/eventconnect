* **Retry Logic:** Implement exponential backoff for transient Google API failures
* **Batch Operations:** Group multiple Google Sheets operations into single API calls when possible

**AI Agent Implementation:**
* **Prompt Engineering:** Create clear, consistent prompts for Google Gemini focused on event planning
* **Context Management:** Build context from Google Sheets data and pass to AI agents efficiently
* **Response Parsing:** Standardize AI response format for consistent UI rendering
* **Cost Optimization:** Monitor token usage and optimize prompts to reduce Google Gemini costs
