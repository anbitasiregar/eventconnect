# Product Requirement Document - EventConnect v1.0

## 1. Vision & Introduction

**Vision:** Help event planners and clients execute flawless events on time, within budget, and with seamless coordination where users are still the creatives and decision makers but AI helps with management and coordination.

EventConnect uses Google Suite as a base to provide a complete event control system with a centralized knowledge hub and has specialized AI agents to handle all aspects of event management and coordination. This includes vendor management, timeline orchestration, budget tracking, guest coordination, and stakeholder communication. This control system is complemented by a Chrome extension so users can access the platform's features seamlessly within their current working environment.

EventConnect comes with event-specific tools and knowledge to help with:
- Centralized knowledge hub for all event information using Google Suite as a foundation
- Timeline synchronization across multiple parties (organizers, clients, vendors)
- Budget tracking with real-time expense monitoring, vendor coordination, and invoice and contract management
- Guest management and communication

**Target users:** Event organizers and event clients who want transparency and control over the event planning process while wanting to delegate repetitive or "busy work" tasks to have more time to make creative decisions and connections. 

**How it works:** Users remain the creative leaders and coordination experts. The AI handles operational tasks, vendor communication, timeline management, and maintains a comprehensive knowledge hub. This creates a collaborative ecosystem where humans focus on creativity and relationships while AI ensures transparent, flawless execution and ensures the user's vision is executed.

## 2. Goals

* **Transparent Coordination:** Remove complexity from event planning by providing a centralized single source of truth that tracks all event information, including timelines, budgets, contracts, guest data, etc.

* **Proactive Recommendations:** Provide intelligent suggestions for next steps, task prioritization, deadline management, and potential issues before they become problems, helping users stay ahead of their event planning timeline.

* **Automate Manual Work:** Significantly reduce time spent on busy work like repetitive vendor follow-ups, status updates, timeline synchronization, and guest management through intelligent automation, letting planners focus on creative design and client relationships.

* **Flexible Integration:** Enable seamless integration with existing event planning tools and vendor systems without forcing workflow changes or data migration.

* **Beautiful Design and Experience:** Create a delightful user experience using beautiful, intuitive design.

* **Analytics & Improvement:** Track platform usage, event success metrics, vendor performance, and client satisfaction to continuously improve AI recommendations and measure event execution quality.

* **Data Security & Privacy:** Ensure enterprise-grade security for all event data, client information, and vendor communications with encryption, access controls, and compliance with privacy standards.

## 3. Core Concepts

EventConnect is built around the following key entities:

* **User:** An individual authenticated via Google SSO who can interact with the platform. Includes event planners and clients with appropriate access permissions.

* **Event Dashboard:** A Google Sheets containing all event details accessible to invited stakeholders (planners, clients, vendors), which will be used the single source of truth for context for the platform, including AI Agents.

* **Event Controller Agent (ECP):** The primary AI agent that acts as an "account manager" between users and the platform's internal capabilities. Handles all user communication, understands event needs, and coordinates with specialized agents behind the scenes to complete tasks.

* **Specialized Agent:** AI entities that work behind the scenes to handle specific event domains:
    * **Communications Agent:** Manages external (guest, vendor, etc.) communication, scheduling meetings, and RSVP management
    * **Timeline & Budget Agent:** Handles event scheduling, milestone tracking, contract management and tracking, payment schedules, and budget monitoring

* **Integration:** A configured connection to external data sources (e.g., Google Suite, HoneyBook, Pinterest, WhatsApp, The Knot, Zola). Provides information for the Event Dashboard and can become integrations for workflows. Supports both pre-configured templates and custom connections.

* **Tool:** A specific function an AI agent can perform (e.g., send vendor email, update timeline, calculate budget, analyze guest RSVPs, track contract status). Tools are the building blocks that agents use to complete tasks.

* **Task:** A specific event objective that users request (e.g., "Follow up with caterer," "Send guest reminders", "Update timeline", "Check budget status"). The ECP receives these requests and coordinates with specialized agents to complete them.

* **Workflow:** The sequence of steps and agent coordination needed to complete a task. Users don't see this complexity - they just make requests to the ECP.

* **Proactive Intelligence:** AI system that continuously analyzes event progress and provides intelligent recommendations for next steps, task prioritization, deadline management, and potential issue identification to keep events on track.

* **TaskRunLog:** Record of completed tasks with status, duration, and outcomes for transparency and tracking.

* **Chrome Extension:** Browser-based access point allowing users to interact with the ECP from any webpage. This is the primary way users interact with this platform.

* **Web App:** Secondary access point for users to interact with the ECP. For more complex workflows.

* **Beautiful Interface Design:** The platform itself is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and simple to use, with clean visual design, intuitive navigation, and engaging interfaces that make event planning enjoyable rather than overwhelming.
